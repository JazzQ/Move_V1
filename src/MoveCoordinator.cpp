// OBJECTIVE: Given the present robot position and orientation on the field and the desired (both in field reference frame coordinates), it determines wheel speeds and directions to get there

// robotFieldPosition -> robotOrigin, desiredFieldPosition -> desiredRobotPosition (robot velocity direction in roboot coordinates)
// must be given desired robot speed to get robot velocity
// find each wheel velocity, speed, and direction
